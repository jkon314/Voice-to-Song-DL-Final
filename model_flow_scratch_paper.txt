preprocessing:


run vocals through stft 
run speech through resemblyzer for style embedding

model should
concat stft (256xT, T being time steps) and 256 resemblyzer vector copied to each time step (creating (256xT) embedding vector)

for batched input, the shape should end up being Nx512xT, N being the number of samples and T being time steps.
